Note: Since we are using Angular 7 and Material design for it, W3 validations won't be possible by just copy-pasting the HTML and CSS source code as Angular and Material design provides 
a lot of different selectors and dependencies on HTML structure. We have ensured that we have followed the W3 standards for creating web pages

Note: Please review the installation guide, in order to run the project.

Pages which have been developed by me:
1) Why Adopt cat page? (Path : http://localhost:4200/why-adopt-cat)
2) Register-Aditya page (Path : http://localhost:4200/registration-aditya)
3) Pet profile page (Path : http://localhost:4200/pet-profile-page)
4) Product detail page (Path : http://localhost:4200/product-detail-page)

Images responsiveness: In order to make the images responsive in all pages, i have used img-fluid and img-responsive classes provided by bootstrap. These classes are available at 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/images/ .

Icons in all pages. I have used font awesome library for using and showing the icons in all of my pages. Information regarding such icons can be found on :
https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/

classes such as input-group, prepend etc, to design the forms. I created the form and assigned and used all the angular built-in classes such as formGroup, formControl etc.I have also
used in-bulit Validation classes of angular to perform all the validations. Information regarding such validations can be found on : https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/jquery/forms/validation/
As of now, i have not put any type of functionality on the register button. Nothing will happen on clicking of the register button, Since only front end needs to be developed as of now.
